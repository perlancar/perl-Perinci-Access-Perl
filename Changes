Revision history for Perinci-Access-Perl

0.52     2013-10-03 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Avoid perl undef warning.


0.51     2013-10-03 (SHARYANTO)

         - wrap cache file: check for staleness.

         - wrap cache file: create legal filename for Windows (no ':').

         - wrap cache file: option to output UTF-8 ('use_utf8' attribute,
           currently undocumented).


0.50     2013-10-02 (SHARYANTO)

         - use err().

         - Add option: disk_cache (default: 0) to cache wrap result to disk.


0.49     2013-09-08 (SHARYANTO)

         [BUG FIXES]

         - 'meta' action returned empty orig_meta.


0.48     2013-09-08 (SHARYANTO)

         - Rename distribution from Perinci-Access-InProcess to
           Perinci-Access-Perl, split Perinci::Access::InProcess to ::Perl and
           ::Schemeless as its superclass. This clears up some things, mainly
           that pl:/Foo/Bar/ must point to Foo::Bar perl package so things like
           package_prefix are moved to Schemeless.


0.47     2013-09-07 (SHARYANTO)

         - Update to Rinci 1.1.36 (entity_version becomes entity_v).

         [BUG FIXES]

         - 'list', 'info', 'actions' actions now correctly check the existence
           of entity first.

         - Subsequent attempt at loading a failed module ($INC{foo} is undef) is
           now correctly reported as error.


0.46     2013-09-07 (SHARYANTO)

         [BUG FIXES]

         - 'list' action should only ignore missing modules, not compile errors.

         - Fix uri parsing: /foo should mean function 'foo', not package 'foo'.

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Add PackagePrefix subclass (proof of concept).


0.45     2013-09-05 (SHARYANTO)

         [BUG FIXES]

         - Fix regression: if package already exists (like 'main'), don't fail
           the module loading. This broke a lot of scripts yesterday.


0.44     2013-09-04 (SHARYANTO)

         - 'meta' action on '/' now works.

         - 'list' action now correctly lists prefixes, e.g. if there are only
           foo::bar::baz and foo::bar::qux, 'list' action on '/foo/' correctly
           lists '/foo/bar/' instead of returning empty.

         - Observe {allow,deny}_paths in 'list' action.


0.43     2013-08-22 (SHARYANTO)

         [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

         - Rename option 'use_wrapped_sub' to 'wrap'.

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Internal refactoring to make custom behavior easier to implement
           (unfinished).

         - Add options 'allow_paths' and 'deny_paths'.

         [REMOVED FEATURES]

         - Remove support for per-entity wrapping flag (via
           _perinci.access.inprocess.use_wrapped_sub property) because it's
           currently unused.

         [ETC]

         - Adjust to Perinci::Access::Base 0.29.


0.42     2013-08-13 (SHARYANTO)

         - Bug fix for parse_url().


0.41     2013-08-13 (SHARYANTO)

         [ENHANCEMENTS]

         - Add parse_url() support.


0.40     2013-08-13 (SHARYANTO)

         [REMOVED FEATURES]

         - Remove dependency on Perinci::Util::get_package_meta_accessor
           (removed in 0.35). Thereby also removing the $PERINCI_META_ACCESSOR
           feature (this variable in a package can point to another class which
           tells people how to get the Rinci metadata for said package). This
           feature is not that useful: we still need to load the module first.
           There are cases where we might want to lookup metadata (or even map
           Riap request uri -> Perl package) from the database without loading
           .pm files. Thus we will rework this class to allow that.


0.39     2012-11-02 (SHARYANTO)

         [BUG FIXES]

         - 'list' action didn't work (fails to list subpackages) when requested
           module does not exist.


0.38     2012-11-02 (SHARYANTO)

         - Add option: use_wrapped_sub (to make it possible to use call original
           sub instead of wrapped version). Can also be set using
           _perinci.access.inprocess.use_wrapped_sub in metadata. Currently I
           don't have a need for this yet.


0.37     2012-10-31 (SHARYANTO)

         - Add option: cache_size (to make it possible to disable caching).
           Currently used for testing/benchmarking overhead.

         - Update to Perinci::Sub::Wrapper 0.33.


0.36     2012-10-24 (SHARYANTO)

         - Pass -progress special argument containing Progress::Any object to
           functions which set 'progress' feature to true.


0.35     2012-08-29 (SHARYANTO)

         - Pass -dry_run => 1 to tx function in dry run mode, so the function
           can detect dry run mode (and, say, display messages).


0.34     2012-08-29 (SHARYANTO)

         - Support '-tx_action_id' to tx function in dry run mode (Rinci
           1.1.28).


0.33     2012-08-29 (SHARYANTO)

         - Support 'dry_run' in call action (Riap 1.1.19).


0.32     2012-08-28 (SHARYANTO)

         - Pass confirmation for actions 'undo' and 'redo' too (actually those
           are the important ones).


0.31     2012-08-28 (SHARYANTO)

         - Implement confirmation (Rinci 1.1.27). Pass Riap request key
           'confirm' => 1 to pass '-confirm' to function (via TM).


0.30     2012-08-22 (SHARYANTO)

         - Adjust to Rinci 1.1.25. No longer check transaction support of
           functions (we'll just let TM do that). No longer provide
           -undo_trash_dir to function to simplify things.


0.29     2012-08-16 (SHARYANTO)

         - Adjust to Rinci 1.1.23 and Perinci::Tx::Manager 0.22. No longer list
           Perinci::Tx::Manager as dependency. Move transaction tests to
           Perinci-Tx-Manager distribution.


0.28     2012-08-10 (SHARYANTO)

         - First release, split to make Perinci dist empty (that dist was a
           growing mixed bag and caused headache in dependencies).
