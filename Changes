Revision history for Perinci-Access-InProcess

0.34     2012-08-29 (SHARYANTO)

         - Support '-tx_action_id' to tx function in dry run mode (Rinci
           1.1.28).


0.33     2012-08-29 (SHARYANTO)

         - Support 'dry_run' in call action (Riap 1.1.19).


0.32     2012-08-28 (SHARYANTO)

         Pass confirmation for actions 'undo' and 'redo' too (actually those are
         the important ones).


0.31     2012-08-28 (SHARYANTO)

         Implement confirmation (Rinci 1.1.27). Pass Riap request key 'confirm'
         => 1 to pass '-confirm' to function (via TM).


0.30     2012-08-22 (SHARYANTO)

         Adjust to Rinci 1.1.25. No longer check transaction support of
         functions (we'll just let TM do that). No longer provide
         -undo_trash_dir to function to simplify things.


0.29     2012-08-16 (SHARYANTO)

         Adjust to Rinci 1.1.23 and Perinci::Tx::Manager 0.22. No longer list
         Perinci::Tx::Manager as dependency. Move transaction tests to
         Perinci-Tx-Manager distribution.


0.28     2012-08-10 (SHARYANTO)

         First release, split to make Perinci dist empty (that dist was a
         growing mixed bag and caused headache in dependencies).
